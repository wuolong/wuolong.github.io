# Installation

- [Emacs For Mac OS X](https://emacsformacosx.com): vanilla build (preferred on mac)
- [GNU Emacs Windows Built](https://gnu.mirror.constant.com/emacs/windows/)
- [Emacs Modified for (macOS|Windows)](https://emacs-modified.gitlab.io): bundled with a few packages (preffered on Windows)
- [Homebrew Emacs Plus (macOS)](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus)

# Configuration

Emacs 27 started to use the `~/.emacs.d` folder and `~/.emacs.d/init.el` init file instead of the old dotemacs
(`~/.emacs`) for configurations. This approach reduces the clutter under the home directory and makes it easier to
manage these files with version control. See [Emacs startup sequences](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Startup-Summary.html) for a list of steps during startup.

- [early-init.el](./early-init.md): Step 6, before the package system and GUI is initialized. The full init file is loaded as Step
  14.
- [Basics](./init-basic.md): the basics
- [Minibuffer](./minibuffer.md)

# Keybinding

## Modifier keys

Compared to Vi(m) that has two modes (Editor and Normal/Command), the "modeless" Emacs has more complicated key
bindings. They rely heavily on modifier keys that are not used in normal text editing. 

- Control (C): first thing I do on a new computer is to map the "Caps Lock" key to "Control" since this is used so
  often. 
  - On Mac, [Settings] -> [Keyboard] -> [Keyboard Shortcuts] -> [Modifier Keys].
  - On Windows, use [Microsoft PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) or customizable keyboards (e.g., Keychron V1).
- Meta (M): by default this is the "ALT" key on Windows. On Mac it's the "Option" key but I like to use "Command"
  key instead.
- Hyper (H): this existed in the original [Space-cadet keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard). On Mac, I use the left "Option" key for this.

## MacOS

Sometimes the OS competes with Emacs for the key bindings so we want to avoid conflict. 

- Here the right Option key is reserved to enter special characters (like Option + R -> Â®). 
- Mission Control uses Control plus arrow or number keys by default. I change to Control+Command instead ([Settings]
  -> [Keyboard] -> [Keyboard Shortcuts] -> [Mission Control]).
- Lastly, check [Settings] -> [Keyboard] -> [Keyboard Shortcuts] -> [Function Keys] to use function keys as F1, F2,
  etc.

```emacs-lisp
(setq ns-command-modifier 'meta                  ;; default is super
      ns-alternate-modifier 'hyper               ;; default is meta, aka ns-option-modifier
      ns-right-alternate-modifier 'none)         ;; for input special character
```
